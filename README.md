# FHIR Implementation Guide Experiment 02
An experimental, externally-template-driven implementation guide being used as a basis for various experiments

## Experimenting with multiple IGs in the one repository

The idea here is that the repository contains the 'library' of profiles some of which are used by IG #1 and others are used by IG #2. Some profiles may be used in both IGs.

Also, some narrative is common between IGs (for navigation bar consistency, eg), while other narrative is unique to a specific IG.
